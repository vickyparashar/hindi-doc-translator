Lila was a curious little girl who loved exploring the woods behind her house. One sunny afternoon, she followed a trail of glittering stones and stumbled upon a tiny door nestled in the roots of an old oak tree. To her surprise, it opened into a cozy room filled with books, glowing mushrooms, and a talking squirrel named Theo. Theo invited her in for tea and tales, and they spent the afternoon swapping stories and laughter. When Lila returned home, she tucked a shiny stone into her pocketâ€”a reminder that magic often hides in the most unexpected places.
